## Personal Thoughts
- This has been challenging as I've learned new database management methods. Using Postman has greatly helped me to have a nice interface to test my endpoints and manipulate data.
- I've learned good methods to handle errors such as making sure my virtual environment is activated and the resources are updated to avoid conflicts.
